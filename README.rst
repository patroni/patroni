Patroni: A Template for PostgreSQL HA with ZooKeeper or etcd
------------------------------------------------------------

Patroni was previously known as Governor.

*There are many ways to run high availability with PostgreSQL; here we
present a template for you to create your own custom fit high
availability solution using python and distributed configuration store
(like ZooKeeper or etcd) for maximum accessibility.*

Getting Started
---------------

To get started, do the following from different terminals:

::

    > etcd --data-dir=data/etcd
    > ./patroni.py postgres0.yml
    > ./patroni.py postgres1.yml

From there, you will see a high-availability cluster start up. Test
different settings in the YAML files to see how behavior changes. Kill
some of the different components to see how the system behaves.

Add more ``postgres*.yml`` files to create an even larger cluster.

We provide a haproxy configuration, which will give your application a
single endpoint for connecting to the cluster's leader. To configure,
run:

::

    > haproxy -f haproxy.cfg

::

    > psql --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5000 postgres

How Patroni works
-----------------

PDF:
`postgres-ha.pdf <https://github.com/zalando/patroni/blob/master/postgres-ha.pdf>`__

YAML Configuration
------------------

For an example file, see ``postgres0.yml``. Below is an explanation of
settings:

-  *ttl*: the TTL to acquire the leader lock. Think of it as the length of time before automatic failover process is initiated.
-  *loop\_wait*: the number of seconds the loop will sleep

-  *restapi*:
    -  *listen*: ip address + port that Patroni will listen to provide health-check information for haproxy.
    -  *connect\_address*: ip address + port through which restapi is accessible.
    -  *auth*: (optional) 'username:password' to protect some dangerous REST API endpoints.
    -  *certfile*: (optional) Specifies a file with the certificate in the PEM format. If certfile is not specified or empty API server will work without SSL.
    -  *keyfile*: (optional) Specifies a file with the secret key in the PEM format.

-  *etcd*:
    -  *scope*: the relative path used on etcd's http api for this deployment, thus you can run multiple HA deployments from a single etcd
    -  *ttl*: the TTL to acquire the leader lock. Think of it as the length of time before automatic failover process is initiated.
    -  *host*: the host:port for the etcd endpoint

-  *zookeeper*:
    -  *scope*: the relative path used on etcd's http api for this deployment, thus you can run multiple HA deployments from a single etcd
    -  *session\_timeout*: the TTL to acquire the leader lock. Think of it as the length of time before automatic failover process is initiated.
    -  *reconnect\_timeout*: how long we should try to reconnect to ZooKeeper after connection loss. After this timeout we assume that we don't have lock anymore and will restart in read-only mode.
    -  *hosts*: list of ZooKeeper cluster members in format: ['host1:port1', 'host2:port2', 'etc...']
    -  *exhibitor*: if you are running ZooKeeper cluster under Exhibitor supervisory the following section could be interesting for you
        -  *poll\_interval*: how often list of ZooKeeper and Exhibitor nodes should be updated from Exhibitor
        -  *port*: Exhibitor port
        -  *hosts*: initial list of Exhibitor (ZooKeeper) nodes in format: ['host1', 'host2', 'etc...' ]. This list would be updated automatically when Exhibitor (ZooKeeper) cluster topology changes.

-  *postgresql*:
    -  *name*: the name of the Postgres host, must be unique for the cluster
    -  *listen*: ip address + port that Postgres listening. Must be accessible from other nodes in the cluster if using streaming replication.
    -  *connect\_address*: ip address + port through which Postgres is accessible from other nodes and applications.
    -  *data\_dir*: file path to initialize and store Postgres data files
    -  *maximum\_lag\_on\_failover*: the maximum bytes a follower may lag
    -  *use\_slots*: whether or not to use replication_slots.  Must be False for PostgreSQL 9.3, and you should comment out max_replication_slots. before it is not eligible become leader
    -  *pg\_hba*: list of lines which should be added to pg\_hba.conf
        -  *- host all all 0.0.0.0/0 md5*

    -  *replication*:
        -  *username*: replication username, user will be created during initialization
        -  *password*: replication password, user will be created during initialization
        -  *network*: network setting for replication in pg\_hba.conf

    -  *callbacks* callback scripts to run on certain actions. Patroni will pass current action, role and cluster name. See scripts/aws.py as an example on how to write them.
        -  *on\_start*: a script to run when the cluster starts
        -  *on\_stop*: a script to run when the cluster stops
        -  *on\_restart*: a script to run when the cluster restarts
        -  *on\_reload*: a script to run when configuration reload is triggered
        -  *on\_role\_change*: a script to run when the cluster is being promoted or demoted

    -  *superuser*:
        -  *password*: password for postgres user. It would be set during initialization

    -  *admin*:
        -  *username*: admin username, user will be created during initialization. It would have CREATEDB and CREATEROLE privileges
        -  *password*: admin password, user will be created during initialization.

    -  *recovery\_conf*: additional configuration settings written to recovery.conf when configuring follower
        -  *parameters*: list of configuration settings for Postgres.  Many of these are required for replication to work.

Replication choices
-------------------

Patroni uses Postgres' streaming replication. By default, this
replication is asynchronous. For more information, see the `Postgres
documentation on streaming
replication <http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/warm-standby.html#STREAMING-REPLICATION>`__.

Patroni's asynchronous replication configuration allows for
``maximum_lag_on_failover`` settings. This setting ensures failover will
not occur if a follower is more than a certain number of bytes behind
the follower. This setting should be increased or decreased based on
business requirements.

When asynchronous replication is not best for your use-case, investigate
how Postgres's `synchronous
replication <http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/warm-standby.html#SYNCHRONOUS-REPLICATION>`__
works. Synchronous replication ensures consistency across a cluster by
confirming that writes are written to a secondary before returning to
the connecting client with a success. The cost of synchronous
replication will be reduced throughput on writes. This throughput will
be entirely based on network performance. In hosted datacenter
environments (like AWS, Rackspace, or any network you do not control),
synchrous replication increases the variability of write performance
significantly. If followers become inaccessible from the leader, the
leader will becomes effectively readonly.

To enable a simple synchronous replication test, add the follow lines to
the ``parameters`` section of your YAML configuration files.

.. code:: YAML

        synchronous_commit: "on"
        synchronous_standby_names: "*"

When using synchronous replication, use at least a 3-Postgres data nodes
to ensure write availability if one host fails.

Choosing your replication schema is dependent on the many business
decisions. Investigate both async and sync replication, as well as other
HA solutions, to determine which solution is best for you.

Applications should not use superusers
--------------------------------------

When connecting from an application, always use a non-superuser. Patroni
requires access to the database to function properly. By using a
superuser from application, you can potentially use the entire
connection pool, including the connections reserved for superusers with
the ``superuser_reserved_connections`` setting. If Patroni cannot access
the Primary, because the connection pool is full, behavior will be
undesireable.

Requirements on a Mac
---------------------

Run the following on a Mac to install requirements:

::

    brew install postgresql etcd haproxy libyaml python
    pip install psycopg2 pyyaml

Notice
------

There are many different ways to do HA with PostgreSQL, see `the
PostgreSQL
documentation <https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Replication,_Clustering,_and_Connection_Pooling>`__
for a complete list.

We call this project a "template" because it is far from a one-size fits
all, or a plug-and-play replication system. It will have it's own
caveats. Use wisely.
