Feature: dcs failsafe mode
  We should check the basic dcs failsafe mode functioning

  Scenario: check failsafe mode can be successfully enabled
    Given I start postgres0
    And postgres0 is a leader after 10 seconds
    Then "config" key in DCS has ttl=30 after 10 seconds
    When I issue a PATCH request to http://127.0.0.1:8008/config with {"loop_wait": 2, "ttl": 20, "retry_timeout": 3, "failsafe_mode": true}
    Then I receive a response code 200
    And Response on GET http://127.0.0.1:8008/failsafe contains postgres0 after 10 seconds
    When I issue a GET request to http://127.0.0.1:8008/failsafe
    Then I receive a response code 200
    And I receive a response postgres0 http://127.0.0.1:8008/patroni
    When I issue a PATCH request to http://127.0.0.1:8008/config with {"postgresql": {"parameters": {"wal_level": "logical"}},"slots":{"dcs_slot_1": null,"postgres0":null}}
    Then I receive a response code 200
    When I issue a PATCH request to http://127.0.0.1:8008/config with {"slots": {"dcs_slot_0": {"type": "logical", "database": "postgres", "plugin": "test_decoding"}}}
    Then I receive a response code 200

  Scenario: check one-node cluster is functioning while DCS is down
    Given DCS is down
    Then Response on GET http://127.0.0.1:8008/primary contains failsafe_mode_is_active after 12 seconds
    And postgres0 role is the primary after 10 seconds

  @dcs-failsafe
  Scenario: check new replica isn't promoted when leader is down and DCS is up
    Given DCS is up
    When I do a backup of postgres0
    And I shut down postgres0
    When I start postgres1 in a cluster batman from backup with no_leader
    Then postgres1 role is the replica after 12 seconds

  Scenario: check leader and replica are both in /failsafe key after leader is back
    Given I start postgres0
    And I start postgres1
    Then "members/postgres0" key in DCS has state=running after 10 seconds
    And "members/postgres1" key in DCS has state=running after 2 seconds
    And Response on GET http://127.0.0.1:8009/failsafe contains postgres1 after 10 seconds
    When I issue a GET request to http://127.0.0.1:8009/failsafe
    Then I receive a response code 200
    And I receive a response postgres0 http://127.0.0.1:8008/patroni
    And I receive a response postgres1 http://127.0.0.1:8009/patroni

  @slot-advance
  Scenario: check leader and replica are functioning while DCS is down
    Given I get all changes from physical slot dcs_slot_1 on postgres0
    Then physical slot dcs_slot_1 is in sync between postgres0 and postgres1 after 10 seconds
    And logical slot dcs_slot_0 is in sync between postgres0 and postgres1 after 10 seconds
    And DCS is down
    Then Response on GET http://127.0.0.1:8008/primary contains failsafe_mode_is_active after 12 seconds
    Then postgres0 role is the primary after 10 seconds
    And postgres1 role is the replica after 2 seconds
    And replication works from postgres0 to postgres1 after 10 seconds
    When I get all changes from logical slot dcs_slot_0 on postgres0
    And I get all changes from physical slot dcs_slot_1 on postgres0
    Then logical slot dcs_slot_0 is in sync between postgres0 and postgres1 after 20 seconds
    And physical slot dcs_slot_1 is in sync between postgres0 and postgres1 after 10 seconds

  @dcs-failsafe
  Scenario: check primary is demoted when one replica is shut down and DCS is down
    Given DCS is down
    And I kill postgres1
    And I kill postmaster on postgres1
    Then postgres0 role is the replica after 12 seconds

  @dcs-failsafe
  Scenario: check known replica is promoted when leader is down and DCS is up
    Given I kill postgres0
    And I shut down postmaster on postgres0
    And DCS is up
    When I start postgres1
    Then "members/postgres1" key in DCS has state=running after 10 seconds
    And postgres1 role is the primary after 25 seconds

  @dcs-failsafe
  Scenario: scale to three-node cluster
    Given I start postgres0
    And I configure and start postgres2 with a tag replicatefrom postgres0
    Then "members/postgres2" key in DCS has state=running after 10 seconds
    And "members/postgres0" key in DCS has state=running after 20 seconds
    And Response on GET http://127.0.0.1:8008/failsafe contains postgres2 after 10 seconds
    And replication works from postgres1 to postgres0 after 10 seconds
    And replication works from postgres1 to postgres2 after 10 seconds

  @dcs-failsafe
  @slot-advance
  Scenario: make sure permanent slots exist on replicas
    Given I issue a PATCH request to http://127.0.0.1:8009/config with {"slots":{"postgres2":0,"dcs_slot_0":null,"dcs_slot_2":{"type":"logical","database":"postgres","plugin":"test_decoding"}}}
    Then logical slot dcs_slot_2 is in sync between postgres1 and postgres0 after 20 seconds
    And logical slot dcs_slot_2 is in sync between postgres1 and postgres2 after 20 seconds
    When I get all changes from physical slot dcs_slot_1 on postgres1
    Then physical slot dcs_slot_1 is in sync between postgres1 and postgres0 after 10 seconds
    And physical slot dcs_slot_1 is in sync between postgres1 and postgres2 after 10 seconds
    And physical slot postgres0 is in sync between postgres1 and postgres2 after 10 seconds
    And physical slot postgres2 is in sync between postgres0 and postgres1 after 10 seconds

  @dcs-failsafe
  Scenario: check three-node cluster is functioning while DCS is down
    Given DCS is down
    Then Response on GET http://127.0.0.1:8009/primary contains failsafe_mode_is_active after 12 seconds
    Then postgres1 role is the primary after 10 seconds
    And postgres0 role is the replica after 2 seconds
    And postgres2 role is the replica after 2 seconds

  @dcs-failsafe
  @slot-advance
  Scenario: check that permanent slots are in sync between nodes while DCS is down
    Given replication works from postgres1 to postgres0 after 10 seconds
    And replication works from postgres1 to postgres2 after 10 seconds
    When I get all changes from logical slot dcs_slot_2 on postgres1
    And I get all changes from physical slot dcs_slot_1 on postgres1
    Then logical slot dcs_slot_2 is in sync between postgres1 and postgres0 after 20 seconds
    And logical slot dcs_slot_2 is in sync between postgres1 and postgres2 after 20 seconds
    And physical slot dcs_slot_1 is in sync between postgres1 and postgres0 after 10 seconds
    And physical slot dcs_slot_1 is in sync between postgres1 and postgres2 after 10 seconds
