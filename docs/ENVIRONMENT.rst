Environment Configuration Settings
==================================

It is possible to override some of the configuration parameters defined in the Patroni configuration file using the system environment variables. This document lists all environment variables handled by Patroni. The values set via those variables always take precedence over the ones set in the Patroni configuration file.

Global/Universal
----------------
-  **PATRONI\_CONFIGURATION**: it is possible to set the entire configuration for the Patroni via ``PATRONI_CONFIGURATION`` environment variable. In this case any other environment variables will not be considered!
-  **PATRONI\_NAME**: name of the node where the current instance of Patroni is running. Must be unique for the cluster.
-  **PATRONI\_NAMESPACE**: path within the configuration store where Patroni will keep information about the cluster. Default value: "/service"
-  **PATRONI\_SCOPE**: cluster name

Log
---
-  **PATRONI\_LOG\_LEVEL**: sets the general logging level. Default value is **INFO** (see `the docs for Python logging <https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/logging.html#levels>`_)
-  **PATRONI\_LOG\_TRACEBACK\_LEVEL**: sets the level where tracebacks will be visible. Default value is **ERROR**. Set it to **DEBUG** if you want to see tracebacks only if you enable **PATRONI\_LOG\_LEVEL=DEBUG**.
-  **PATRONI\_LOG\_FORMAT**: sets the log formatting string. Default value is **%(asctime)s %(levelname)s: %(message)s** (see `the LogRecord attributes <https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/logging.html#logrecord-attributes>`_)
-  **PATRONI\_LOG\_DATEFORMAT**: sets the datetime formatting string. (see the `formatTime() documentation <https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/logging.html#logging.Formatter.formatTime>`_)
-  **PATRONI\_LOG\_MAX\_QUEUE\_SIZE**: Patroni is using two-step logging. Log records are written into the in-memory queue and there is a separate thread which pulls them from the queue and writes to stderr or file. The maximum size of the internal queue is limited by default by **1000** records, which is enough to keep logs for the past 1h20m.
-  **PATRONI\_LOG\_DIR**: Directory to write application logs to. The directory must exist and be writable by the user executing Patroni. If you set this env variable, the application will retain 4 25MB logs by default. You can tune those retention values with `PATRONI_LOG_FILE_NUM` and `PATRONI_LOG_FILE_SIZE` (see below).
-  **PATRONI\_LOG\_FILE\_NUM**: The number of application logs to retain.
-  **PATRONI\_LOG\_FILE\_SIZE**: Size of patroni.log file (in bytes) that triggers a log rolling.
-  **PATRONI\_LOG\_LOGGERS**: Redefine logging level per python module. Example ``PATRONI_LOG_LOGGERS="{patroni.postmaster: WARNING, urllib3: DEBUG}"``

Bootstrap configuration
-----------------------
It is possible to create new database users right after the successful initialization of a new cluster. This process is defined by the following variables:

-  **PATRONI\_<username>\_PASSWORD='<password>'**
-  **PATRONI\_<username>\_OPTIONS='list,of,options'**

Example: defining ``PATRONI_admin_PASSWORD=strongpasswd`` and ``PATRONI_admin_OPTIONS='createrole,createdb'`` will cause creation of the user **admin** with the password **strongpasswd** that is allowed to create other users and databases.

Consul

-  **PATRONI\_CONSUL\_HOST**: the host:port for the Consul local agent.
-  **PATRONI\_CONSUL\_URL**: url for the Consul local agent, in format: http(s)://host:port

-  **PATRONI\_CONSUL\_CHECKS**: (optional) list of Consul health checks used for the session. By default an empty list is used.
-  **PATRONI\_CONSUL\_REGISTER\_SERVICE**: (optional) whether or not to register a service with the name defined by the scope parameter and the tag master, replica or standby-leader depending on the node's role. Defaults to **false**
-  **PATRONI\_CONSUL\_SERVICE\_CHECK\_INTERVAL**: (optional) how often to perform health check against registered url

Etcd
----

-  **PATRONI\_ETCD\_PROXY**: proxy url for the etcd. If you are connecting to the etcd using proxy, use this parameter instead of **PATRONI\_ETCD\_URL**
-  **PATRONI\_ETCD\_URL**: url for the etcd, in format: http(s)://(username:password@)host:port
-  **PATRONI\_ETCD\_HOSTS**: list of etcd endpoints in format 'host1:port1','host2:port2',etc...
-  **PATRONI\_ETCD\_USE\_PROXIES**: If this parameter is set to true, Patroni will consider **hosts** as a list of proxies and will not perform a topology discovery of etcd cluster but stick to a fixed list of **hosts**.
-  **PATRONI\_ETCD\_PROTOCOL**: http or https, if not specified http is used. If the **url** or **proxy** is specified - will take protocol from them.
-  **PATRONI\_ETCD\_HOST**: the host:port for the etcd endpoint.

-  **PATRONI\_ETCD\_KEY**: File with the client key. Can be empty if the key is part of certificate.

ZooKeeper
---------
-  **PATRONI\_ZOOKEEPER\_HOSTS**: comma separated list of ZooKeeper cluster members: "'host1:port1','host2:port2','etc...'". It is important to quote every single entity!

Exhibitor
---------

-  **PATRONI\_EXHIBITOR\_PORT**: Exhibitor port.

.. _kubernetes_environment:

Kubernetes
----------
-  **PATRONI\_KUBERNETES\_NAMESPACE**: (optional) Kubernetes namespace where the Patroni pod is running. Default value is `default`.
-  **PATRONI\_KUBERNETES\_LABELS**: Labels in format ``{label1: value1, label2: value2}``. These labels will be used to find existing objects (Pods and either Endpoints or ConfigMaps) associated with the current cluster. Also Patroni will set them on every object (Endpoint or ConfigMap) it creates.
-  **PATRONI\_KUBERNETES\_SCOPE\_LABEL**: (optional) name of the label containing cluster name. Default value is `cluster-name`.
-  **PATRONI\_KUBERNETES\_ROLE\_LABEL**: (optional) name of the label containing Postgres role (`master` or `replica`). Patroni will set this label on the pod it is running in. Default value is `role`.
-  **PATRONI\_KUBERNETES\_USE\_ENDPOINTS**: (optional) if set to true, Patroni will use Endpoints instead of ConfigMaps to run leader elections and keep cluster state.
-  **PATRONI\_KUBERNETES\_POD\_IP**: (optional) IP address of the pod Patroni is running in. This value is required when `PATRONI_KUBERNETES_USE_ENDPOINTS` is enabled and is used to populate the leader endpoint subsets when the pod's PostgreSQL is promoted.
-  **PATRONI\_KUBERNETES\_PORTS**: (optional) if the Service object has the name for the port, the same name must appear in the Endpoint object, otherwise service won't work. For example, if your service is defined as ``{Kind: Service, spec: {ports: [{name: postgresql, port: 5432, targetPort: 5432}]}}``, then you have to set ``PATRONI_KUBERNETES_PORTS='[{"name": "postgresql", "port": 5432}]'`` and Patroni will use it for updating subsets of the leader Endpoint. This parameter is used only if `PATRONI_KUBERNETES_USE_ENDPOINTS` is set.
