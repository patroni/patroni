Running tests
-------------

Requirements for running behave tests:

1. PostgreSQL packages need to be installed.
2. PostgreSQL binaries must be available in your `PATH`. You may need to add them to the path with something like `PATH=/usr/lib/postgresql/11/bin:$PATH python -m behave`.
3. If you'd like to test with external DCSs (e.g., Etcd, Consul, and Zookeeper) you'll need the packages installed and respective services running and accepting unencrypted/unprotected connections on localhost and default port. In the case of Etcd or Consul, the behave test suite could start them up if binaries are available in the `PATH`.

 Install dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

    # You may want to use Virtualenv or specify pip3.
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install -r requirements.dev.txt

After you have all dependencies installed, you can run the various test suites:

.. code-block:: bash

    # You may want to use Virtualenv or specify python3.

    # Run flake8 to check syntax and formatting:
    python setup.py flake8

    # Run the pytest suite in tests/:
    python setup.py test

    # Run the behave (https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) test suite in features/;
    # modify DCS as desired (raft has no dependencies so is the easiest to start with):
    DCS=raft python -m behave
